								The purpose of Archstone Physiotherapy and Wellness Centre is to develop a centre of excellence for the provision of physiotherapy and other allied health services. We will provide a high quality, evidence based practice, while striving to establish respectful partnerships with clients.
 							</p>
 							<p style="text-align: left;">
								We are extremely proud to have staff members who have demonstrated leadership and exceptional skill in their chosen areas of practice.
							</p>
							<p style="text-align: left;">
								Archstone is the first clinic in the Saint John region to focus on the comprehensive treatment of abdominal and pelvic health problems for women, men, and children. The pelvis is the foundation of support for your body and we believe that it should get the attention it deserves. Through education, training, and experience we are able to develop customized treatment approaches that fit each individual. Research has consistently demonstrated that using physiotherapy treatments such as biofeedback, joint mobilizations, stretching, strengthening and trigger point release can significantly reduce or eliminate pelvic floor disorders.
							</p>
							<p style="text-align: left;">We feel that knowledge is the first step on your journey to wellness. Frances has been a
								guest lecturer at UNBSJ and frequently speaks to a variety of groups, including gyms,
								places of employment, community groups etc. If you would be interested in having our team
								speak to your group on women’s health issues, please contact the clinic and we will be
								thrilled to arrange a convenient time.

									It is an exciting time to be a pelvic and women’s health  physiotherapist! When I first graduated in 1983 as a physiotherapist, women’s health and pelvic health physiotherapy was not even on the radar. Women were told to do Kegel exercises, often without any coaching, and that was that. 
								</p>
								<p style="text-align: left; margin-right: 3%; margin-left: 3%;">
									What triggered my interest in becoming a pelvic floor physiotherapist is the same reason many women seek my help now. After I completed my 2nd physiotherapy degree in 2009 , I leapt into cycling and swimming however my 50 year old body had not kept up with my physical ambition. My low back was a problem so I started weight lifting. My pelvic floor complained every time I lifted weights. So off to the pelvic physio I went to find out I had a pelvic organ prolapse.
								</p>
								<p style="text-align: left; margin-right: 3%; margin-left: 3%;">
									Now, we understand that the ability to manage intraabdominal pressure is one component of regaining pelvic muscle floor function. Hypopressive breathing  allowed me to regain my athletic confidence and it is an exercise  I use to  introduce women in the post-natal and 3rd Age stages of life  to their pelvic floor, their posture and most importantly , their breathing.
								</p>
								<p style="text-align: left; margin-right: 3%; margin-left: 3%;">
									Completing the 3rd Age Woman Peri-to-Post Menopause  Certification with Burrell Education gave me  health information to support the recovery of my  athleticism with pelvic organ prolapse. Of course the next step was to become a Holistic Core Restore ® coach. I am passionate about assisting women to reclaim their physical selves through pelvic health rehabilitation at all stages of their lives. I provide my  patients with exercises, health information and an approach to their pelvic health condition. The HCR® program supports that process by providing my patients  with weekly video and coaching contact.
